# 1. The AWS Cloud Credit for Research (ACCR) programme
[ACCR](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research/) supports the public sector in the adoption of cloud technologies under research and training projects. It provides funding in the form of credit that can only be used to pay for the cost of using AWS services under such projects. 

### Types of projects
The type of projects considered under ACCR include:

- *Proof of concept or benchmark tests*:\
That evaluate the efficacy of moving research workloads or open data sets to the cloud.

- *Development of repeatable, sharable solutions*:\
That build cloud-hosted publicly available science-as-a-service applications, software, or tools to facilitate a community's future research.

- *Advanced workshops or tutorials*:\
That train a broader community on the use of cloud for research workloads.

ACRC "does **not** support administrative workloads, operational projects, or ongoing projects".

### Eligibility
ACRC is open to full-time faculty, full-time researchers, and students at an accredited research institution. Graduate, post-graduate and PhD students are eligible. ACCR is intented for relatively long (up to one year), research-oriented projects. Student awards can be up to a maximum of US $5,000.00 --- faculty and researcher awards have no limit.

If you want to learn cloud skills rather than conduct research, the [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) is a free programme available to everyone.

### Awards and scope

The awarded amount will depend on the research proposal and AWS service  requirements in your application. An award is referred to as **AWS Promotional Credit** or **Promotional Credit**.  The Promotional Credit you receive may be **less** than you applied for. 

Once you receive an award, it is referred to as **AWS Promotional Credit** or **Promotional Credit**.  The Promotional Credit you receive may be **less** than what you asked in your application. This may be because AWS is "encouraging a different cost model leveraging *spot instances* or providing funding for a smaller, initial proof of concept portion of a new project".

Promotional credit **has some restrictions in use**. Usage of EC2 services is **only covered** under the pricing schemes *pay-as-you-go* (also known as *on-demand*) and *Spot Instances* only. Also, Promotional Credit **cannot be used** to pay for **previous charges** or charges for any of the folllowing AWS services: 

"*Amazon Mechanical Turk, AWS Managed Services, Ineligible AWS Support, AWS Marketplace, AWS Professional Services, AWS Training, AWS Certification, Amazon Route 53 domain name registration or transfer, any Services for mining for cryptocurrency, any other Services as may be designated by your AWS contracting entity, or any upfront fee for any Services such as Savings Plans and Reserved Instances (collectively, “Ineligible Services”). For purposes of this Section 1, “Ineligible AWS Support” means AWS Support (as described on the AWS Site) that is at the Enterprise Support level*". 

**You will be billed** if you use any of those services. 

Please see other restrictions and guidelines in the [AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions](https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/).

### The application process at a glance

You will be informed of the **the outcome of your application** in an email from **aws-research-credit@amazon.com** (check your spam folders) within 120 days but often much sooner. 

If your application is successful, you will receive Promotional Credit directly applied to your AWS account or an email with a *Promotion Code* to redeem in your account on the **Billing Dashbord**. 

If your application is **not** successful, you can submit your **revised** application

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/01-accr-redeeming-credit.png "Redeeming AWS Promotion Code."){: width="900px"}

### Other points you should know

**Acknowledgements**:\
You should acknowledge your ACCR award as "AWS Cloud Credit for Research" in any outcome of your project.

**How long is Promotional Credit valid?**:\
Promotional Credit expires after one year from the time it is applied to your account or until it is used entirely. Any promotional credit not used after the expiration date is forfeited. Once any of these conditions happen, **your credit card will be charged** for any AWS services you use. Check your credit regularly or set Billing Alerts through the Billing Dashboard.

**You can submit another application for the same project**:\
If your project runs for longer than planned, you can apply for another ACCR award explaining your project progress and including any outcomes and milestones you have reached.

# 2. Preparing your application to ACCR

To apply for an ACCR award, you will fill and submit the online application form here: [ACRC Application Details](https://pages.awscloud.com/aws-cloud-credit-for-research.html). You will need:

- An AWS account --- you will need to enter your 12-digit account number 
- a research project description --- guidelines below
- a Faculty Advisor --- you will need to give their name
- an institution email address
- a phone number

### Writing your research project

Your research project must include the following (from [ACRC Application Details](https://pages.awscloud.com/aws-cloud-credit-for-research.html)):

1. Description of problem to be solved.
2. Proposed Amazon Web Services (AWS) solution (including specific AWS tools, timeline, key milestones).
3. Plan for sharing outcomes (tools, data, and/or resources) created during your project.
4. Any potential future use of AWS beyond grant duration by individual research groups or broader community.
5. Names of any AWS employees you have been in contact with (this is not a prerequisite for the application).
6. Any AWS Public Data Sets to be used in your research.
7. Keywords to facilitate proposal review.

In preparing you research project consider the following:

"AWS approves applications based on factors such as clearly defined outcomes, potential to disseminate the results and data through sharing a pipeline or software, succinctly defined milestones, the applicability of AWS services within the project scope, and value of AWS Promotional Credit requested suited to the scope of the project (as evidenced by a link from the AWS Pricing Calculator to substantiate the AWS Promotional Credit desired)" [\[Factors AWS considers to determine who receive Promotional Credit\]](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research/faqs/proposal-preparation/).

The evaluation of your project by AWS will focus on "\[**A**\] the reusability of the expected outcome of the project and \[**B**\] on  the demonstrated \[proof of concept\] efficacy of AWS for a research workload".

"Examples of reusable outcomes include publicly available AMIs, code repositories, or reduced data sets. Proof of concept or other pilot projects that explore how well AWS services match with common research workloads are also of interest. These might include benchmarks or use case reports".

Should you need to submit your project again, revise the two subjects above, reusability and proof of concept, before resubmitting.

By all means, see if it is at all possible for your Faculty Advisor to revise your project before you submit it. If so, hand in a full version of the project to your Advisor, covering all the steps 1-7, as you may only have one revision by your Advisor and you want feedback on the entire project if possible.

### Filling the application form

All fields in the ACCR application form are **required** and the filling of most of them is straightforward.

However, the following two fields require preparation:
- *Save and Share URL from AWS Pricing Calculator*
- *Project Description*

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/02-accr-application-form-cost-url-project-description.png "Filling ACCR form --- Estimated Cost and Project Description."){: width="900px"}

The field *Save and Share URL from AWS Pricing Calculator* requires that you enter the URL of the cost estimate of your project. You need to prepare it with the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) --- civered in the next topic "3. Getting the cost estimate of your project".

We recommend preparing the *Project Description* in a plain text editor (**not** Word) before pasting it into the box. 

# 3. Getting the cost estimate of your project

To get the cost estimate you will need a list of services and the estimated "capacity" of each", that you need. You enter these in the AWS Pricing Calculator. Your estimate of the *capacity* (not cost) of each service and the configuration you choose for the service do not have to be precise. 

### Cost estimate example

Let's suppose the following: 
1. You created your instance as suggested in the lesson [Create and Manage your AWS instance](https://cloud-span.github.io/create-aws-instance-2-manage-instance/) so that it is Free-Tier eligible, that is: you created an instance of type *t2.micro* (with 1 processor and 1 GB memory) and 30 GB Elastic Block Storage (EBS). 
2. You have used your instance for a few weeks and found that some of your programs take too long to finish and you would like to process a larger data set that you need to transfer into your instance storage
3. You want to apply for ACCR Promotional Credit to upgrade your instance to be of type *t2.medium* (2 processors and 4 GB memory) and 120 GB storage.  

Thus, we are going to get a cost estimate for an EC2 instance t2.medium and 120 GB EBS storage. 

You may recall that, when you use your instance, you also use the *Key Management Service* (KMS) and the *Data Transer* (DT) service, both of which are *always-free* services with 20,000 free requests per month  and 100 free GB per month respectively. In this example, we assume those always-free monthly quotas will be enough for your project but if you think you nee more, you can include them in your cost estimate as described below.

### Getting the cost estimate and its URL

Go to the page of the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) --- you do **not** need to login to your account to access the pricing calculator.

Once the AWS Pricing Calculator page appears, click on **Create estimate** and the "Select service" page will appear. 

Type **ec2** in the search box to display only the services whose name contain EC2. The service we are interested in is the first one: "Amazon EC2". In the "Amazon EC2" box, click **Configure**.

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/03-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2.png "AWS Pricing Calculator showing the 'Select service' page with 'ec2' typed in the search box and the 'Amazon EC2' service listed first") 

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/03-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2.png "AWS Pricing Calculator --- EC2."){: width="900px"}

The page "Configure Amazon EC2" below should have appeared. Select the box "Advance estimate" and then scroll down until you see the heading "EC2 Instances". Continue below.
![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/04-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-advEstimate.png "Pricing EC2."){: width="900px"}

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/05-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-t2.medium.png "The 'EC2 Instances (1)' search box showing 't2.medium' typed in and the 't2.medium --- 4 GiB --- etc' listed in the table.") 

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/05-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-t2.medium.png "Pricing t2.medium instance."){: width="900px"}{: width="900px"}

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/06-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-pricing-model.png "'Pricing Strategy' showing 'On-Demand' selected") 

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/06-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-pricing-model.png "Choosing pricing model."){: width="900px"}

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/07-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-120EBS.png "'Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)' showing 120 in 'Storage amount' and 'Snapshot Frequency' set to 'No snapshot storage'.") 

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/07-accr-pricing-calculator-ec2-120EBS.png "Pricing EBS storage."){: width="900px"}

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/08-accr-pricing-calculator-total-monthly-estimate.png "The Monthly cost estimate.") 

The costs shown correspond to the *monthly* fees of each service and the total for both services in US dollars.

Click on "Add to my estimate" and continue below.

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/08-accr-pricing-calculator-total-monthly-estimate.png "Monthly cost estimate."){: width="900px"}

The page that appears (below) will show your cost estimate for 12 months at the top, and the details of your instance configuration below: Ireland region, intance type t2.medium, 120 EBS storage, On-Demand Pricing strategy.

Note the options at the top: **Add service**, **Add support**, .., and **Share**.

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/09-accr-pricing-calculator-annual-estimate.png "Annual cost estimate."){: width="900px"}
![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/10-accr-pricing-calculator-annual-estimate-details.png "Cost estimate details."){: width="900px"}

In this example, we do not need to add any services but you could add more using **Add service**. You can create as many cost estimates as you want. They are deleted after three years. 

**Share** is what you need for your application. Click on **Share**

You will then be asked to **Agree and continue** to save your cost estimate and given the opportunity to **Copy public link** to the estimate. This is the URL you need for your application.

The two options below will appear, one at a time. 

Click on **Agree and continue** to save your cost estimate. 

Thenk click on **Copy publick link** to get the URL or copy-paste it the usual way. 

![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/11-accr-pricing-calculator-save-estimate.png "Saving cost estimate."){: width="900px"}
![Caption.](../fig/aws-credit4research/12-accr-pricing-calculator-estimate-public-linkurl.png "Cost estimate URL."){: width="900px"}

That's it. 

This is the end of the course "Create Your Own AWS Instance".

We hope you find it useful.
